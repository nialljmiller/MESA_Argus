"""Population grid: realistic (initial mass, [M/H], alpha_MLT) combinations for display.

NOT a full cube. Every track is a star that plausibly exists in the populations
Argus sees (Milky Way thin/thick disk, halo, globular clusters, LMC), and each
one is there for a reason, given in its `why`.

  * [M/H] levels are tied to real populations. Low-[M/H] levels only carry
    masses old enough (<= ~0.85 Msun) to still exist there today; massive stars
    only appear where star formation is ongoing (thin disk, LMC).
  * alpha_MLT is solar-calibrated for every track, plus +/-0.3 variants.
    0.3 roughly brackets the spread that 3D convection simulations
    (Trampedach+2014, Magic+2015) and APOGEE/Kepler giants (Tayar+2017) give
    around the solar value. Variants are only run where an outer convective
    envelope sets Teff (cool dwarfs, giants, blue loops).
  * The atmospheres are scaled-solar Kurucz, so [M/H] is total metallicity.
    For alpha-enhanced halo stars, [M/H] ~= [Fe/H] + 0.3 (Salaris+1993).
