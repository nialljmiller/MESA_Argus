"""SED grid for the Argus simulator: five stars spanning the CMD, with every model's SED kept.

Each run writes the interpolated atmosphere SED at every history step (f_lambda at 10 pc),
packed into runs/<track>/seds.h5 together with that step's stellar parameters and
synthetic magnitudes (mesa_argus.seds).

The two low-mass stars stop at the RGB tip (helium ignition). Following them through the
He flash and horizontal branch costs many hours of run time, and the flash itself is a
numerical transient, not an observable phase.
