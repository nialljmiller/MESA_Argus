"""An alert sample for an alert broker: hdps's packets exactly as hdps wrote them, and beside them what the

                                                 decide which alerts exist (bright-star mask, real/bogus model and
                                                 cut), the schema version, packet counts by truth class

The packets are the stream Argus would send (mesa_argus.alert_files: hdps's AlertVettingTask builds every packet,
the file stands in for Kafka); nothing in them is changed or added. The truth comes from the engine's
<name>_night_<band>.alerts.csv (every hdps candidate with its features and its truth, alertId from the packets).

A night run in two halves, one band each (observation files <night>_beta and <night>_rho with [output] bands = one
band: one engine per run fits a smaller machine), is the same night: no seed derives from the name or the bands
(the stars, [inject] and [night] seeds are explicit; the engine's noise is seeded per exposure from [output]
noise_seed), so both halves hold the same scene, as long as both run on one machine (the [inject] templates are drawn
from that machine's stars/ library). Such a half is filed under its night, <out>/<night>/<band>/, and the halves of a
night are checked to hold the same scene (scene/sources.json and scene/exposures.ecsv): a night whose halves differ
stops the run.

The cut: hdps sends a packet only for a candidate whose score is at or above AlertVettingTask's score_cut
(emit_all_candidates adds below-cut rows to the alert catalogue, never packets), and no packet field depends on the
cut. So a night run with score_cut = 0 (a packet for every candidate, the real/bogus model loaded) and selected here
with --cut C holds exactly the packets a run at score_cut = C sends (checked on hdps's v4.0 AlertVettingTask: every
field equal but alertId and the build timestamp, which differ between any two runs), and the cut can change without
running the night again. --cut takes a number or an operating point of --bundle (e.g. fa10).

## Cutouts

Every packet carries cutoutScience, cutoutDifference and cutoutTemplate, as ADR-0030 sec. 4 and TN-0004 ("Cutouts")
specify: 32 x 32 little-endian IEEE 754 float32 in electrons, 4096 bytes each, row-major in the TAN segment's [y, x]
order (byte 4 * (32 * row + col) holds segment pixel (x0 + col, y0 + row), (x0, y0) the stamp's lowest-index corner;
no rotation, CDELT1 negative: +y north, -x east at the segment's tangent point). Read one with
`numpy.frombuffer(packet["cutoutDifference"], "<f4").reshape(32, 32)`.

- Centered on every alert: the exposures are 60 s, and the BOOM/Argus meeting chose centered cutouts at 15-minute
  and longer cadence and, Plan A, at 1-minute cadence. TN-0004 leaves the centered placement TBD; here the
  candidate's rounded pixel (round(y), round(x)) is at [row 16, col 16] (x0 = round(x) - 16, y0 = round(y) - 16), the
  convention of hdps's own alert stamps extended to an even size. Pixels beyond the segment's edge are NaN.
- Science: the science tile before subtraction (sky included); difference: SFFT's difference plane; template: the
  reference coadd on the tile that SFFT subtracts against (hdps's retained presub_science and presub_reference: the
  planes of hdps's own alert stamps). The template ships for v4 until the broker hosts Argus reference images
  (optional per the meeting).
- Pixel values are as hdps's tiles hold them: electrons per sensor-pixel area (hdps's reprojection keeps surface
  brightness, 0.879" tile pixels against 1.007" sensor pixels), so a star summed over a cutout is about 1.31 times its
  electrons.
- The filling is our implementation of ADR-0030 sec. 4 in hdps's AlertVettingTask (a local commit on top of hdps PR
  #474, which defers cutout extraction): hdps's own code, the planes hdps already cuts its alert stamps from, until
  hdps's producer PR lands.
"""

KNOWN_GAPS = """\
## Known gaps

The schema: hdps PR #474 (schema v4.0) is under review. The BOOM/Argus meeting decided on a single schema in which an
alert holds a candidate with either an eventAssociation or an ssoAssociation child (the other null); PR #474 instead
removes eventAssociation and puts eventId on the envelope, which is what its requested change is about. Expect the
schema to change before it merges; this sample follows PR #474 as it stands.

Gaps of hdps's v4.0 producer:
- psfFluxDifErr is -1.0 (not produced) until hdps exposes the flux error from extract_features (hdps#476);
- coadd is true on every alert (hdps#477);
- fields with no producer yet are explicit blanks: filter 0, cameraIds/otaIds/filterIds/focuserIds/subarrayIds [],
  referenceId -1 and the reference times 0.0, alertCadence 0; no solar-system association runs (ssoAssociation null);
- JD(TT) is computed from hdps's Argus-epoch anchor inline (until hdps#410's argus_epoch_to_jd);
- candidates without a sky position or a finite difference flux are not sent;
- on Kafka each message would be one schemaless Avro record (topic and framing still to be decided upstream); here
  each exposure's packets are one Avro object container file with the schema embedded.
