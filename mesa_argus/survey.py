"""Observing as the survey does (observe.py's [night] observing = "survey"): which exposures Argus actually takes of a
position, through which telescope, in which band, where in that telescope's field, and the seeing of each ratchet.

All from ArgusSim:
- coverage: coverage_exact.covering, its ring layout (thinB: 1190 telescopes, each in g = beta or rho) and ratchet
  schedule (60 s exposures, 14 min tracking + 1 min reset, Sun below -18 deg); a position is observed in an exposure
  when it falls inside a telescope's field. Where two telescopes overlap it is observed by both (two records, often in
  both bands); between telescopes and outside the array's footprint, not at all.
- field angle: the position's angle from that telescope's optical axis, in the array frame (the PSF depends on it).
- seeing: one zenith seeing per ratchet, drawn from the site's seasonal model (survey.draw_seasonal_seeing, Barker et
  al. 2003), x airmass^0.6 per exposure (as in ArgusSim); seeded, so a seed is one realisation.
Not included: weather (lost nights), clouds (transparency 1).
